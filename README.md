# react_sample_submission_project
CRUD operations for sample submission, uses axios for requesting the back end and bootstrap for styling

For serving the back end and for testing purposes you need to use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) on this way: 


json-server --watch -p3001 src/samples.json
